Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) successfully enhanced its store management system by integrating it with the ERP platform and automating critical processes using Robotic Process Automation (RPA). The project focused on streamlining the procurement and distribution workflows, including re-order level management, to address inefficiencies in the manual system.

Through this initiative, RPA processes were developed to handle end-to-end tasks such as inventory monitoring, procurement requests, supplier coordination, and distribution tracking. By automating these workflows, the project significantly improved operational efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors.

The integration of RPA with the ERP system enabled SLT to achieve better resource utilization, ensure timely reordering of inventory, and optimize supply chain operations. This not only saved valuable time but also reduced operational costs, allowing the organization to focus on strategic goals and decision-making.

The automation project reinforced SLTâ€™s commitment to leveraging innovative technology for process improvement, ensuring high standards of accuracy, and delivering consistent results. The successful implementation of this system demonstrates the value of RPA in transforming traditionally manual processes into streamlined, cost-effective operations.
